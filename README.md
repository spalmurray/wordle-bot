# wordle-bot
A Discord bot to track you and your friends' Wordle scores, so you can see who's the best! To submit a score to wordle-bot, just paste the Wordle score share in a Discord server that wordle-bot is a member of, as shown in the demo photo below. Note that your scores are bound to your Discord user id, not any particular server, so you can submit a score on one server and have it shown in another server's rankings.

To add the bot to your Discord server, click [here](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=933891782373158943&permissions=67584&scope=bot)!

Feb 3 Update: The bot has reached 100 servers and cannot be added to any more until Discord verifies the bot. The process has been started, but may take some time. I'm sorry for the inconvenience and hope you'll come back to check in! I will keep this note updated with any news. :)
